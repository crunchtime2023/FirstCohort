        <h1><br><br><br><br><br><br>Brownie Recipe</h1><br><br>

        <p id="intro">This is a very simple brownie recipe. I am using <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-ever-chocolate-brownies-recipe" target="_blank">this</a> website to assist me in the ingredients and which order to cook them. It is a beginners guide so everyone should be able to follow through without having any struggles. Now, let's get started!
        </p><br>

        <p id="ingredients">
            First things first, you will want to gather all the ingredients needed to make the brownie.<br>
            The list of things you will need are:
            <ul id="ingredientslist">
                <li><b>Unsalted butter:</b> About 185g should be good.</li><br>
                <li><b>Best dark chocolate:</b> 185g will do the job.</li><br>
                <li><B>Plain flour:</B > 85g will do justice.</li><br>
                <li><b>Cocoa Powder:</b> 40g for perfection.</li><br>
                <li><b>White chocolate:</b> 50g and thats good for the mix.</li><br>
                <li><b>Milk chocolate</b> 50g as an addition to the dark and white chocolate.</li><br>
                <li><b>Large eggs:</b> 3 of them should be enough so you don't taste it too much or make it too bland. </li><br>
                <li><b>Golden caster sugar:</b> 275g to top it off.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p id="extra">Also, if you feel like doing so, later on you may add your own ingredients such as crushed oreos, chocolate sprinkles and more.</p>
        </p>

        <p id="inbetween">
            Now lets get on with the actual making!
        </p><br>

        <p id="first" id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 1</b><br>
            Cut 185g unsalted butter into small, diced cubes and put them in a bowl, preferrably medium sized. Once this is done, break the dark chocolate into small pieces and drop them into the bowl with the butter.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 2</b><br>
            Fill a saucepan, preferrably a smaller sized one, with about quarter full of hot water and then sit the bowl on top so that it rests on the pan, <b>without touching the water</b>. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have metled, stirring occasionaly to mix them.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 3</b><br>
            Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternativelty, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put it in the microwave for 2 minutes on <b>high</b>. Then, leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.<br>
            While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160fan/gas 4.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 4</b><br>
            Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square shape of kitchen foil, or non-stick baking parchment, to the line of the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a seive held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 5</b><br>
            Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 6</b><br>
            Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. Then, with an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar until they look thick and creamy (like a milk shake).<br>
            This can take anywhere from 3 minutes up to 8 minutes depending on how powerful your electric mixer is. You will know it is ready when the mixture becomes very pale and about double its original volume.<br>
            Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture leaves a trail on the surface for a second or two then it is ready.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 7</b><br>
            Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold rogether with a rubber spatula.<br>
            Plung the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle.
            Continue going over and under in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown.<br>
            Be as gentle and slow as you like
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 8</b><br>
            Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture adn resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top eventually.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 9</b><br>
            Gently hold this powder using the same figure of eight action as before.<br>
            The mixture will look dry and dusty at first but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking fudgy.<br>
            Stop just before you feel you should as you don't want to overdo this mixing.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 10</b><br>
            Finally, stir the white and milk chocolate chunky until they are dotted through.<br>
            Now you can pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping it all out with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 11</b><br>
            Put it in the oven and set your timer for 25 minutes. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle then it's not quite done so give it an extra 5 minutes to bake until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are beginning to come away fro, the tin. Take out the oven
        </p>

        <p id="content">
            <b id="steps">Step 12</b><br>
            Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you are using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base.<br>
            If you are using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil (or patchement). Cut it into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.
        </p> <br>
